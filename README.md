# kubernetes-sitespeed.io


Hello  

First of all this is a thought around a website metrics management, is not the only way, but is one way for a high level overview.

How to read this ...  
 - i'm focused to share some concept about website monitoring
 - i'm sharing a possible way to manage in kubernetes  
 - i'm using some other tools in kubernetes just because i'm evaluating this for other purpose  

So you can reach the GOAL just using docker and crontab for example
<br/><br/>
## Motivations 
Well ... a website is a product itself,  
it could be a Wordpress, a Magento ecommerce or a structured multiple applications that owns each ones a different section of the website.  

However if you have a business on top you should move your evolution as a customer perspective
- how long does is take the website asnwer ?   
- is the response time common for all sections ?
- new versions/deployments are better than before for the customer ? 

You know, if the response time is more than X seconds ... and you are selling a common gadgets that could be retrieved elsewhere , you are losing money and customer affiliation.  

There are also some others problems... when someone in your company or a customer will say ... the website il slow  

- Faster from my fiber home connection
- Faster from my mobile premium plus SIM
- Slow from wireless
- Fast from wireless
- No idea
- Faster than â€¦ ?!?! compared to ... ?!?!  



And this is the reaction about a subjective evaluation

Now, we know a that the we need DATA  
evaluate those during a long therm periode looking for performance
- release by release
- feature by feature
- etc etc


First of all we have to test our websites on the customer position... so no 1gbit inline connection with 0.00001 roungtrip :) 

From the multitude of products , webtest , lighthouse , selenium and so on i really like sitespeed.io
<br/><br/>

## Sitespeed&#46;io

This tool is open source , has a huge extension , in this scenario  
i'll use only parts of that since i don't need the video recording, or HAR files and so on.  

A full report could be useful to check all feature and you can find here  
https://lorenzogirardi.github.io/sitespeedio-results/

![sitespeed-results](https://res.cloudinary.com/ethzero/image/upload/v1601387533/misc/sitespeed-results.png "sitespeed-results")   

and you can have those results only with using the docker image

```docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/sitespeed.io" sitespeedio/sitespeed.io:15.2.0 https://www.k8s.it/```

is know easy understand that you can extend in crontab this code and add some other option to store metrics and results files in s3 for example  

```/usr/bin/docker run --privileged --shm-size=1g --rm --network=cable sitespeedio/sitespeed.io httos://www.example.com -v -b chrome --video --speedIndex -c cable --browsertime.iterations 1 --s3.key S3_KEY --s3.secret S3_SECRET --s3.bucketname S3_BUCKET --s3.removeLocalResult true --s3.path S3_PATH www.ecample.com --graphite.host GRAPHITE_HOST --graphite.port GRAPHITE_PORT --graphite.namespace GRAPHITE_PREFIX```



<br/><br/>

Here we will use only metrics
